# Subject site template

The **UI** of a subject site's hub page (the shelf): sign-in screen, book
covers, search, sort, filters, cards / list / compact views, the gear and the
app icons. It is **code only**: no books, no keys.

Subject sites (for example
[`habit-reader`](https://github.com/eckko/habit-reader), made from
[`subject-reader-shell`](https://github.com/eckko/subject-reader-shell)) hold
**encrypted data files only**. Their `index.html` is a tiny fixed loader that
reads the UI version from the subject's own `subject.json` and loads this UI
from jsDelivr. **Every change to the subject UI is made here**, then released
as a new tag. Subject sites follow a **major version** (`"uiVersion": "1"` =
the newest `1.x.x`), so minor and patch releases reach them without any change
in the subject repo; a new major version is adopted by hand, by editing
`subject.json`.

```
css/hub.css               all styles of the hub (neutral default look)
js/hub.js                 the hub: markup, sign-in screen, shelf, gear, icons
js/status.js              admin only: the book status band and page (loaded on demand)
css/status.css            styles of the admin status band and page
firestore/status.rules    the Firestore rules the admin status needs
img/icon.svg              neutral default favicon
img/apple-touch-icon.png  neutral default 180x180 home-screen icon for iOS
```

The template holds **no subject's own look**. Since 2.0.0 the sign-in screen
and the icons of a subject (Habit, Emotion, ...) live in that subject's repo
(see "Theme a subject" below).

## Use it in a subject repo

`subject.json` names the UI version:

```json
{ "title": "Habit", "templateTag": "3.2.4", "uiVersion": "2",
  "theme": { "css": ".theme/gate.css", "icon": ".theme/icon.svg",
             "appleTouchIcon": ".theme/apple-touch-icon.png" },
  "bookDetails": { "<book id>": { "authors": ["Name"], "edition": "2nd", "year": 2018 } } }
```

- `title`: the heading. `templateTag`: the `recall-quiz-site-template` tag whose
  tools check the site. `bookDetails`: optional (authors, edition, year).
- `theme`: optional, see below.
- `uiVersion`: `"2"` (newest 2.x.x), `"2.1"` (newest 2.1.x) or `"2.0.0"`
  (exactly that release). Use the major normally; pin an exact one to stop
  updates.

The shell's `index.html` (it never changes) has this loader at the end of
`<body>`; it adds the favicon and iOS icon itself through `js/hub.js`:

```html
<script>
(function () {
  "use strict";
  function fail(text) {
    var p = document.createElement("p"); p.textContent = text;
    document.body.appendChild(p);
  }
  fetch("subject.json", { cache: "no-cache" }).then(function (r) {
    if (!r.ok) { throw new Error("subject.json: HTTP " + r.status); }
    return r.json();
  }).then(function (subject) {
    var v = String(subject.uiVersion || "");
    if (!/^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){0,2}$/.test(v)) {
      throw new Error('subject.json needs "uiVersion" such as "1"');
    }
    var s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eckko/subject-site-template@" + v +
      "/js/hub.js";
    s.onerror = function () { fail("Could not load the hub UI (" + v + ")."); };
    document.body.appendChild(s);
  }).catch(function (e) { fail("Could not start: " + e.message); });
})();
</script>
```

`hub.js` loads `css/hub.css` (and, unless the theme names its own, the default
icons) from the same version, then reads `subject.json` and `books.json` next to
the page. `books.json` is written by the quiz template's
`tools/site/build_hub.py`.

## Theme a subject

A subject gives its sign-in screen and icons their own look from **its own
repo**; nothing about it is released here. All keys of `theme` are optional,
and each is a plain relative path inside the subject's folder (no scheme, no
leading `/`, no `..`; anything else is ignored). Keep them in a dot-folder such
as `.theme/`: the site check of the quiz template (`build_hub.py --check`)
counts every other top-level folder as a book and fails without a `book.json`:

| key | what it is |
|---|---|
| `css` | a stylesheet loaded **after** `css/hub.css`, so it wins |
| `icon` | browser favicon (`.svg`, `.png` or `.ico`) |
| `appleTouchIcon` | iOS home-screen icon, a plain square 180x180 PNG |

Without `theme`, a subject gets the neutral default look and icons. A missing
or broken theme file never stops the page.

A theme stylesheet usually only sets variables on `:root` and gives the empty
art area a picture (a `url()` in the stylesheet is relative to that stylesheet,
so keep the picture next to it):

```css
:root {
  --gate-bg: #f6efe2;            /* page behind the sign-in screen */
  --gate-fg: #23303a;            /* title, text, outlines, focus ring */
  --gate-muted: #4d5a62;         /* the short lines of text */
  --gate-button-bg: #23303a;     /* the main (Sign in) button */
  --gate-button-fg: #f6efe2;
  --gate-heading-font: "Fraunces", Georgia, serif;
  --gate-focus: #d9654f;         /* optional, default = --gate-fg */
}
#gate .gate-art { background: url("contours.svg") center / cover no-repeat; }
```

Web fonts: put an `@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/...")` first in
the theme stylesheet. Keep the text readable: `--gate-fg` and `--gate-muted`
on `--gate-bg`, and `--gate-button-fg` on `--gate-button-bg`, need strong
contrast. Themes hold no book content.

## Other templates this UI uses

`js/hub.js` loads sign-in (`js/unlock.js`), the gear (reading panel, themes)
and fonts from
[`eckko/recall-quiz-site-template`](https://github.com/eckko/recall-quiz-site-template)
at `QUIZ_TEMPLATE_TAG` (top of `js/hub.js`). The hub starts in the Classic
theme, light, at 16px; a reader's own gear choices win.

## Release a version

1. Change files here, open a PR, merge to `main`.
2. Create a release tag `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (for example `1.1.0`: no `v`, never
   a branch). Subject sites load `@1`, so they get it without any change.
   Use the **Create release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`):
   Actions > "Create release" > Run workflow, pick the branch (default `main`)
   and `patch`, `minor` or `major`, or from a script
   `gh workflow run release.yml -f branch=main -f release_type=minor`. It
   works out the next tag from the newest `x.y.z` tag, tags the tip of the
   branch and publishes a release with generated notes. It stops without
   creating anything if no `x.y.z` tag exists, the branch has no commits since
   the newest tag, or the new tag already exists.
3. Subject sites on `"uiVersion": "1"` may take minutes to hours to see it: jsDelivr caches a
   version range. To refresh at once, open
   `https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/eckko/subject-site-template@1/js/hub.js`
   (and the same for `css/hub.css`).

**Versioning rules** (subject sites follow `@1`, so these matter):

- patch (`1.0.1`): a fix. Minor (`1.1.0`): a new feature. Both **must stay
  backward compatible**: a subject repo's `index.html`, `subject.json`,
  `books.json` and book folders keep working unchanged.
- major (`2.0.0`): anything that breaks them (a renamed `subject.json` key, a
  new required file, a changed book folder format, a changed default look).
  Subject repos move to it by hand: set `"uiVersion": "2"` in their
  `subject.json`.
- **2.0.0** (breaking): the template no longer ships Habit's teal sign-in
  screen and icons. The default sign-in screen is neutral, and a subject gives
  itself its look with `theme` in `subject.json`. A subject that moves to
  `"2"` without a theme gets the neutral look, so Habit adds its theme first
  (its old look is in its own repo).
- A tag is immutable. A bad release is fixed with a newer patch tag, never by
  moving a tag.

## Try it locally

Serve a subject repo with this folder standing in for the CDN (the test
setup routes `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/eckko/subject-site-template@<tag>/` to this
folder); sign in with the subject key. There is no build step.

## Checks

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs `node --check js/hub.js` and verifies the
tags and files described above.

## Admin book status (3.0.0)

An admin sees how far each book is: files, structure, notes and quiz, each with
an **Auto-checked** part (the book-pipeline "Check books" workflow) and a
**You verified** part (your own sign-off in the reader). It is hidden from every
other reader: nothing extra is downloaded for them.

- **Turn it on:** sign in as an admin, open the gear, and switch on **Admin >
  Book status**. Each book gets a footer band (a status dot in the compact
  list). **Status >** opens the full page: finished or not-started stages are
  collapsed; a stage that needs you is open, says what to do, and has **Open in
  reader** and **Mark verified** per format.
- **Who is an admin:** a user with a document `admins/<uid>` in Firestore (made
  by hand in the Firebase console). Everyone else never sees the switch.
- **Where the data is:** Firestore `bookStatus/<book folder>` with `auto`
  (written by the pipeline) and `signoffs` (written by the page, latest only).
  Nothing is stored as "stale": a sign-off whose hash differs from the current
  file's hash, or whose structure hash differs, is stale when read.
- **Rules:** merge `firestore/status.rules` into the project's rules.
- **Pipeline:** `eckko/book-pipeline`, workflow "Check books" (nightly, and by
  hand). It needs the secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
- **Re-run checks** opens that workflow in GitHub; set `"admin": {"workflowUrl":
  "..."}` in `subject.json` to point it somewhere else.
- The Firebase SDK version in `hub.js` must equal `FIREBASE_VERSION` in the quiz
  template's `js/unlock.js` (they share one Firebase app; if they differ the
  admin switch simply does not appear).

This is a **major** release because the hub now depends on Firestore rules and
the pipeline workflow. A subject site adopts it by editing `uiVersion` to `"3"`.
Run the logic tests with `node --test tests/status.test.js`.
